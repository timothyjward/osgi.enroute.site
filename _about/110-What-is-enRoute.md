## What is enRoute?
enRoute is intended to provide a gentle, hands-on introduction to those who wish to start building modular systems. 

* enRoute enables the quick and simple creation of stand-alone OSGi applications.
    * Providing basic guidance for using R7 specifications.
    * Providing a simple set of dependencies for using OSGi R7 Reference Implementations
* enRoute takes an opinionated approach focusing on 
    * Declarative Services 
    * and a Maven based tool chain.
* All enRoute examples are based on the latest OSGi Specifications and Reference Implementations.

enRoute is not intended to be an encyclopaedia for experienced OSGi developers, nor is enRoute aligned with any particular open source initiative. enRoute is intended to be a useful toolbox, and to give a solid understanding of the basics of OSGi. 

## Why is enRoute needed?

[Java is the software industry's leading language](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/), a position broadly held since 2003. Yet despite this the average Java developer is not an OSGi developer. 

Why is this?

![Lowering the barriers](/img/book/why-enroute.png)

* Until recently OSGi examples and tools exposed too much infrastructure to new developers: yes *OSGi was hard*.
* As demonstrated by DropWizard & Spring Boot the software industry tends to focus on the rapid creation of new simple stand-alone Applications that **"just run"**. In stark contrast, the OSGi Alliance places priority upon the creation and ongoing cost effective maintenance of sophistcated software systems.
* The internet - which never forgets - is littered with outdated (and sometimes woefully incorrect) OSGi tutorials and articles: someone of these reflecting the evolution of OSGi principles and best-practices since 1998!

enRoute removes these barriers and provides the on-ramp via which Java developers can build modern, modular, maintainable software systems.
