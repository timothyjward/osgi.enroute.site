Realising the need for a simple on-ramp for Developers, the [OSGi Alliance](https://www.osgi.org) engaged [Peter Kriens from aQute](http://aqute.biz); the results of Peter's efforts [were announced in 2015](http://blog.osgi.org/2015/10/osgi-enroute-10.html). enRoute 1.0 shaped several important OSGi R7 Specifications, and perhaps more importantly provided the _context_ against which the OSGi Alliance could discuss next steps.  

The present enRoute _refresh_ project is the result of those discussions and experiences. [Paremus Ltd](http://www.paremus.com) were engaged by the OSGi Allaince to refocus enRoute around the R7 Specifications and a Maven based tool chain. 

## Looking ahead

Over the next few months the enRoute project will continue to expand the examples to demonstrate the best use of OSGi Alliance R7 Specifications. 

Looking further ahead enRoute will continue to track the OSGi Specification process, with new enRoute examples being created to demonstrate R8 capabilities and beyond.

## How to Contribute?

_How can I get involved?_

Feedback & contributions are very much appreciated. However remember that enRoute is focused on a Developer audience unfamiliar with OSGi and structural modularity.

_How can my Organisation support enRoute and OSGi?_

Please consider joining as an OSGi Allaince member. It is the funding generated by OSGi Allaince Membership that helps fuel the OSGi specification processes, and activities like enRoute.
