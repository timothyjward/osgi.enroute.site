## OSGi Specifications

enRoute is based upon the lastest OSGi Allaince Specifications, see:

* [R7 Core Specifications](https://osgi.org/hudson/job/build.core/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/osgi.specs/generated/html/core/index.html)
* [R7 Compendium Specifications](https://osgi.org/hudson/job/build.cmpn/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/osgi.specs/generated/html/cmpn/index.html)

Each OSGi Alliance Specification is accompanied by a Reference Implementation and an associated Conformance Test suite: these resources maintained by the OSGi Alliance Members.

Noteable Reference Implementions include:

* [Apache Felix](http://felix.apache.org) -
* [Eclipse Equinox](https://www.eclipse.org/equinox/) -
* [Apache Aries](http://aries.apache.org) -


## R7 Examples 

The following resources provide additional examples and tutorials. Development toolchains may vary relative to that used by enRoute.

* [Paremus Service Fabric](https://docs.paremus.com) - a set of distributed enRoute style examples running upon the Service Fabric: an OSGi Enabled Cloud platform.
* B
* C


## OSGi Toolchains

The following resources provide further information and guidance on developing with OSGi. 

* [The bndtools IDE plugin for Eclipse](http://bndtools.org) - The easy, powerful and productive way to develop with OSGi. Based on bnd and Eclipse. 
* [The bnd Community Site](http://bnd.bndtools.org) - The engine behind popular software development tools that support OSGi.


## OSGi Developer Certification

The [OSGi Alliance Developer Certification Program](https://www.osgi.org/osgi-compliance/developer-certification/) validates the OSGi skills and knowledge of IT professionals; so providing an independent referenceable verification.

The current certification program is intended for experienced hands-on OSGi Developers. However, the OSGi Alliance are considering an online enRoute Certification, this as a first step towards full Certification.


## OSGi Testimonials

It is increasingly realised that OSGi Specifications provide the modular foundations upon which economically sustainable software solutions can be built. The following testimonials are from Solutions providers (Enterprise, E-Commerce, IoT) that have realised this unique opportunity.

## The 'OSGi Enabled' Ingredient Mark

![test](img/OSGiMark_Enabled_RGB.png){: width="150px"}

**OSGi Enabled** identifies a Product or Service that is compliant with one or more OSGi specifications, and so modular in both design and implementation: see the **OSGi Enabled** [solutions register](https://www.osgi.org/osgi-compliance/osgi-enabled/osgi-enabled-products-and-services/).

For further details on Usage Terms see [**OSGi Enabled**](https://www.osgi.org/osgi-compliance/osgi-enabled/get-osgi-enabled/).
