## OSGi Specifications

The OSGi Allaince R7 Specifications, upon which enRoute is based, are now viewable online: see,

* [R7 Core Specifications](https://osgi.org/hudson/job/build.core/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/osgi.specs/generated/html/core/index.html)
* [R7 Compendium Specifications](https://osgi.org/hudson/job/build.cmpn/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/osgi.specs/generated/html/cmpn/index.html)

Each OSGi Alliance Specification is accompanied by a Reference Implementation and an associated Conformance Test suite: these resources maintained by the OSGi Allaince Members.

These include:

* [Apache Felix](http://felix.apache.org) -
* [Eclipse Equinox](https://www.eclipse.org/equinox/) -
* [Apache Aries](http://aries.apache.org) -

The following resources provide additional examples and tutorials. Development toolschains may vary to that used by enRoute.

## OSGi Developer Certification

The [OSGi Alliance Developer Certification Program](https://www.osgi.org/osgi-compliance/developer-certification/) validates the OSGi skills and knowledge of IT professionals; so providing independent referenceable verification. 

The current certification program is intended for experienced hands-on OSGi Developers. However, the OSGi Alliance are considering an online enRoute Certification as a first step towards full Certification.


## The 'OSGi Enabled' Ingredient Mark

The **OSGi Enabled** mark is available to software vendors which wish to demonstrate that their products and / or services are compliant with one or more OSGi specifications. **OSGi Enabled** identifies a product or service that is modular in both design and implementation.
