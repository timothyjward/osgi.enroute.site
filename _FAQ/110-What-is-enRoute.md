enRoute is intended to provide a gentle, hands-on introduction to those who wish to start building modular systems. 

* enRoute enables the quick and simple creation of stand-alone OSGi applications.
    * Providing basic guidance for using R7 specifications.
    * Providing a simple set of dependencies for using OSGi R7 Reference Implementations
* enRoute takes an opinionated approach focusing on 
    * Declarative Services 
    * and a Maven based tool chain.
* All enRoute examples are based on the latest OSGi Specifications and Reference Implementations.

enRoute is not intended to be an encyclopaedia for experienced OSGi developers, nor is enRoute aligned with any particular open source initiative. enRoute is intended to be a useful toolbox, and to give a solid understanding of the basics of OSGi. 

## Why is enRoute needed?

[Java is the software industry's leading language](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/), a position broadly held since 2003. Yet despite this the average Java developer is not an OSGi developer. 

There are several reasons for this:

* As demonstrated by DropWizard & Spring Boot the modern software industry is focus on the rapid creation of new stand-alone of Applications that you can **"just run"**; without being concerned about down-stream maintenance. OSGi has never had this priority.
* The internet - which never forgets - is littered with outdated (and sometimes woefully incorrect) OSGi tutorials and articles: someone of these reflecting the evolution of OSGi principles and best-practices.
* OSGi examples and tools exposed too much to new developers: yes *OSGi was hard*.

Today, using modern tools and OSGi Release 7 specifications, enRoute completely removes the barrier to developing modular, maintainable software systems. There is no longer any excuse for not using OSGi!

## Relationship to previous version of enRoute?

The OSGi Alliance, realising the need to create a simple on-ramp for new Developers, engaged Peter Kriens to create a simple experience for a Developer new to OSGi; the results of which - enRoute 1.0 - [was announced in 2015](http://blog.osgi.org/2015/10/osgi-enroute-10.html). 

This first version of the enRoute project helped to show where OSGi could be improved to make it easier, and significantly shaped several of the specifications in OSGi R7. enRoute 1.0 also provided a context against which OSGi members could discuss next steps.  The present enRoute project is the result of those discussions and experiences. 

## Looking ahead

enRoute will be continued to be enhanced with simple examples that demonstrate the best use of OSGi Alliance R7 Specifications. Looking ahead enRoute will continue to track the OSGi Specification process, with new enRoute examples being created to demonstrate R8 capabilities and beyond.
