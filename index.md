enRoute provides a simple set of Tutorials and Examples for those unfamiliar with OSGiâ„¢. 

enRoute provides a development on-ramp that is simple to use; but critically achieves this without sacrificing the maintainability, adaptiability & evolvability advantages unique to OSGi. 

enRoute is based upon the latest OSGi Alliance Specifications and best practices; and at least initially, enRoute takes an opinionated approach to the development toolchain focusing on Maven.
