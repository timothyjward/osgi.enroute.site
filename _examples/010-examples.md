summary: A walkthrough of the Quick Start exmple 
---

The quickstart example is a simple OSGi enRoute application created from the enRoute project archetype. It contains a single OSGi service which exposes a REST endpoint and some static files, and an application project which packages up the service and its dependencies into a runnable JAR file.

The OSGi enRoute quickstart example project uses Apache Maven as a build tool. Therefore at the root of the project is a reactor pom.xml.

## The Reactor POM

The reactor POM is responsible for setting common configuration for the build plugins used by modules in the build, and for setting the scopes and versions of common dependencies. As the enRoute example projects all live in a single workspace their reactor poms inherit this configuration from their parent, however in a single-application project the following items would be included directly in the reactor

## Plugin configuration
The reactor pom defines configuration for the following plugins:

### The bnd-maven-plugin

The bnd-maven-plugin is a key plugin when producing OSGi bundles. The bnd maven plugin is responsible for parsing the bytecode of the classes included in the JAR file being produced by a module. Based on the discovered annotations and dependencies the bnd-maven-plugin will construct an OSGi Manifest file for the bundle, and any other required metadata.

Note that the maven-jar-plugin must be configured to accept this externally generated manifest.

OSGi enRoute further configures the bnd-maven-plugin to give a more friendly symbolic name for projects that use short artifact ids, to include sources in the generated bundle, and to use OSGi Contracts (TODO link this) when they are available

### The bnd-export-maven-plugin
The bnd-export-maven-plugin is used to export an OSGi application as a runnable JAR.

### The bnd-indexer-maven-plugin
The bnd-indexer-maven-plugin is used to generate an OSGi repository index from the set of maven dependencies in your module’s pom. This repository index can be used for resolving or exporting the application.

The indexes used in OSGi enRoute are typically for intermediate or local usage, so the repository URLs in the index point at files on the local file system. Also, by default the index contains only the compile and runtime scoped dependencies, so this plugin defines a second execution for generating an index of the test scoped dependencies. This is used when running and resolving the application with debug utilities, and for use in integration testing

### The bnd-resolver-maven-plugin

The bnd-resolver-maven-plugin is not normally part of the main build, but it can be used from the command line to resolve an application or integration testing bndrun.

### The bnd-baseline-maven-plugin
The bnd-baseline-maven-plugin is used to validate the semantic versioning (TODO link) of a bundle’s exported API by comparing it against the last released version. This plugin will fail the build if the API version has not been increased when a change has been made, or if the version increase is insufficient to communicate the semantics of the change.

## Dependency Configuration
The pom also defines the following common dependencies

### APIs
The OSGi and Java EE APIs commonly used in OSGi enRoute applications are included at provided scope. This is because they should not be used at runtime, instead being provided by implementations, such as the OSGi framework.

### Implementations
The OSGi reference implementations used in OSGi enRoute are included at runtime scope so that they are eligible to be selected for use by the application at runtime, but not available to compile against.

### Debug and Test
The remaining dependencies are made available at test scope so that they may be used when unit testing, integration testing, or debugging OSGi enRoute applications



## The rest Module

The rest module contains the main bundle for the application. It contains a simple declarative services component in under src/main/java, and a unit test in src/test/java. The src/main/resources folder contains files contributing a Web User Interface for the component.

### The POM

The pom.xml is simple, it includes the OSGi API, enterprise API and testing dependencies required by the module, and it activates the bnd-maven-plugin which will generate the OSGi manifest, and a Declarative Service descriptor for the component

### The DS Component
The DS component contains a number of important annotations.

Firstly the @Component annotation marks this type as a Declarative Services Component, the service attribute means that even though this type does not directly implement any interfaces it will still be registered as a service. This annotation also acts as a requirement for a Declarative Services implementation at runtime.

The @JaxrsResource annotation marks this service as a JAX-RS resource type that should be processed by the JAX-RS whiteboard. It also acts as a requirement for the JAX-RS Whiteboard implementation.

The @HttpWhiteboardResource annotation indicates to the Http Whiteboard that this bundle contains one or more static files which should be served over HTTP. The pattern attribute indicates the URI request patterns that should be mapped to resources from the bundle, while the prefix attribute indicates the folder within the bundle where the resources can be found

Finally the @Path, @GET and @PathParam annotations are defined by JAX-RS, and used to map incoming requests to the resource method “toUpper(String)” which converts the incoming String to upper case and then returns it.

### The Unit test

The unit test makes use of JUnit 4 to perform a basic test on the Upper service

## The app module

The app module is responsible for gathering together the rest module and all of its dependencies into a runnable OSGi application.

### The POM

The pom.xml is simple, it references the rest module, the OSGi reference implementations, and the OSGi debug bundles.

To create the exported application requires an OSGi repository index, so this module enables the bnd-indexer-maven-plugin, and it uses the bnd-export-maven-plugin to export the app.bndrun file.

Finally this project enables the bnd-resolver-maven-plugin for the app.bndrun and debug.bndrun, so that these files may be resolved from the command line.

### The app.bndrun

The app.bndrun sets up the requirements and launch parameters for the quickstart application.

Firstly the file defines the index that will be used by this bndrun, and uses it to configure this as a standalone bndrun file (meaning that it does not inherit from the rest of the workspace) so that only items from the index will be used when resolving.

Next the file defines the run requirements using -runrequires. This uses the OSGi requirement syntax to select the rest module.
Finally the file declares the OSGi framework implementation that should be used, and the Java version that should be assumed when resolving.

The remaining section -runbundles is automatically when resolving. It contains the complete list of bundles that have been determined to be needed to run the application.

If you are in an IDE then this file can be run and resolved directly, otherwise the file can be resolved from the command line and run as an executable JAR file.

### The debug.bndrun

The debug.bndrun inherits the requirements and launch parameters from the app.bndrun, and adds:
An additional repository index for the test bundles
Requirements for the Felix Gogo shell and the Felix web console

As a result when this bndrun file is resolved and run it includes the main application and the debug bundles, making this an easy way to debug the application when running in an IDE. If command line debugging is preferred then the export maven plugin can be reconfigured to export the debug.bndrun, rather than the app.bndrun.
