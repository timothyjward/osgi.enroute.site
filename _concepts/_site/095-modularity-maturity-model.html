<p>Talk about reuse-release equivalence here?</p>

<p>A more organisation perspective ….</p>

<p>The <em>Modularity Maturity Model</em> was proposed by Dr Graham
Charters at the OSGi Community Event 2011, as a way of describing how
far down the modularity path an organisation or project is. It is named
for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model">Capability Maturity
Model</a>, which
allows organisations or projects to measure their improvements on a
software development process.</p>

<p>As a work in progress, these levels may change over time. Once it has
reached stability this paragraph will be removed and a link to the
normative specification will be added.</p>

<p>Note that these terms are largely OSGi agnostic and that it can be
applied to any modularity model. It is also intended as a guide rather
than prescriptive.</p>

<h2 id="level-1-ad-hoc">Level 1: Ad Hoc</h2>
<hr />

<p>At the Ad-hoc level, there isn’t any formal modularity. A flat class
path issued with a bunch of classes with no, or limited, structure.</p>

<p>They may use ‘library JARs’ to access functionality but typically
results in a monolithic application.</p>

<h3 id="benefits">Benefits</h3>

<p>The main benefit of this is the low cost and low barrier to entry.</p>

<h2 id="level-2-modules">Level 2: Modules</h2>
<hr />

<p>Modules are explicitly versioned and have formal module identities,
instead of merely classes (or JARs of classes). In particular, and a key
point of this, is that dependencies are done against the module identity
(including version) rather than the units themselves.</p>

<p>Maven, Ivy, RPM and OSGi are all examples of where dependencies are
managed at the versioned identity level instead of at the JAR level.</p>

<h3 id="benefits-1">Benefits</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Decouple module from artefact</li>
  <li>Clearer view of module assembly</li>
  <li>Enables version awareness through build, development and operations</li>
  <li>Enables module categories</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="level-3-modularity">Level 3: Modularity</h2>
<hr />

<p>Module identity is not the same as modularity.</p>

<p>Modules are declared via module contracts, not via artefacts. The
requirements can take the general form of the capabilities and
requirements, but could be a specific realisation (e.g. a particular
package). The private parts of the modules are an implementation detail.</p>

<p>In this level, dependency resolution comes first and module identity is
of lesser importance.</p>

<h3 id="benefits-2">Benefits</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Fine-grained impact awareness (for bug fixes, implementation or
client breaking changes)</li>
  <li>System structure awareness</li>
  <li>Client/provider independence</li>
  <li>Requirement-based dependency checking</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="level-4-loose-coupling">Level 4: Loose coupling</h2>
<hr />

<p>There is a separation of interface from implementation; they are not
acquired via factories or use constructors to access the
implementations. This provides a services-based module collaboration
(seen in OSGi, but also present in some other frameworks like Spring or
JNDI to hide the construction of the services from the user of those
services).</p>

<p>In addition, the dependencies must be semantically versioned.</p>

<h3 id="benefits-3">Benefits</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Implements a client/provider independence</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="level-5-devolution">Level 5: Devolution</h2>
<hr />

<p>At the devolved level, artefact ownerships are devolved to
modularity-aware repositories. They may support collaboration or
governance for accessing the assets by relation to the services and
capabilities required.</p>

<h3 id="benefits-4">Benefits</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Greater awareness of existing modules</li>
  <li>Reduced duplication and increased quality</li>
  <li>Collaboration and empowerment</li>
  <li>Quality and operational control</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="level-6-dynamism">Level 6: Dynamism</h2>
<hr />

<p>Provides a dynamic module life-cycle, which allows modules to
participate in the life cycle events (or initiate them). Will have
operational support for module addition/removal/replacement.</p>

<h3 id="benefits-5">Benefits</h3>

<ul>
  <li>No brittle ordering dependencies</li>
  <li>Ability to dynamically update</li>
  <li>Can allow fixes to be hot-deployed and to extend capabilities
without needing to restart the system</li>
</ul>
